# Microphone-to-FPGA-Interface-Circuit
This is a PCB with three-channel microphone interface conditions and digitizes analog audio from lapel mics. It amplifies signals 150×, filters noise, and outputs digital data via SPI. Compatible with FPGAs and 3.3V microcontrollers like STM32, ESP32, and Arduino for real-time audio processing.
